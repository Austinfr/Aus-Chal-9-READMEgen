## Goal

To make a generator for readme markdown files so that I can automate and make the process of writing a readme file. 

## Installation

Node.js, a package manager that works with npm are required for this project.
Clone this repo to somewher local and run npm install to get set up.

## Usage

After installing everything you can go ahead and run node index.js to start up the prompts and go through them one by one. 
Used to generate a basic readme markdown template so that the bulk of the work is done. Add any more information that is necesarry by manipulating the file directly.

## Tests

See what you can put in as input for each of the sections or see how it looks without certain sections. See if putting a link formatted to markdown works as intended when opening the file up.
